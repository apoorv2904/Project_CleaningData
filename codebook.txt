Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

The above mentioned variables are all numerical variables.

There are two other variables used in this tidy_data.txt. These are

activity - A factor variable with 6 levels.  Levels: WALKING WALKING_UPSTAIRS WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS SITTING STANDING LAYING
subject - The id of the subjects in experiment. Factor Variable with 30 levels. Levels: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

Transformation : From the raw data. For the variables mentioned above the average value of the variables was taken grouped by activity and subject.

Notes
- Tidy data "tidy_data.txt" contains 180 records each with 81 variables.
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'tidy_data_names.txt'
